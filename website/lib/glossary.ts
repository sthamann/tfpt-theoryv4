    short:
      "The E₈ closure feeds back as an internal consistency check: g_car = 5 is forced three ways and the 8 in c₃ = rank E₈ = h(D₅) = φ(30) are recovered independently. The bootstrap overdetermines the discrete core; only π stays free.",

      "The metric-sector interface (historically labelled G_metric): R + R² is heat-kernel grounded (G2) and gap-decoupled (G5); the closing statement is the index-4 μ₄ seam-net inclusion ⇒ holomorphic (E₈)₁. Net existence and full-cone reflection positivity are discharged to [E] (v175); the residual is then reduced (v176–v181) to a single definitional premise QGEO.SYM.01 — the carrier μ₄ clock is the conformal deck of the seam — which is bedrock, not reducible further without relabeling. The deduction below the premise is now machine-checked: the geometric normal form (UNIFORM: z↦iz, σρσ=ρ⁻¹, orbit→μ₄, multiplier order-4 ⇔ ζ=±i; FORM.QGEO.02) and the conditional implication mark-local ⇒ ω∘ρ=ω (FORM.QGEO.01) are Lean-formalised (AUDIT: PASS, only the three standard kernel axioms), so QGEO.SYM.01 itself stays the one [O] postulate. The whole emergent-QFT layer collapses onto this same premise (the Modular Spectral Closure, v258–v261: the finite Dirac is a covariance induction of the seam KMS state, the spectral-action cutoff is that KMS weight with f₂/f₀ = 1, and the seam, carrier-16 and E₈ live on one Kummer/K3 surface), so the boundary QFT is one relative object closed modulo QGEO.SYM.01 and adds no new open item. That premise is now a single named theorem, the Seam Equivalence Theorem (SEAM.EQUIV.01, v286): the raw RP seam IS the holomorphic (E₈)₁ net at τ=i (χ_E8(i)=12, v282), with an import firewall keeping its two routes non-circular; Route A (AQFT, v287) reduces it to one standard import, and Route B (DtN, v288) proves the full-L² ℤ₄ block-diagonality of the subprincipal term — so the residual is the single sharper question 'why is the raw seam subprincipal term mark-local?'. Full QG closure is a certification layer, not a prerequisite for testing the readouts [C]/[O].",

Koide source→pole, η_B source→Boltzmann relic, axion scale→abundance and m_p/m_e→QCD/EW matching are four instances of this one missing functor — not primitive compiler predictions [C]. The functor contract CONTRACT.F.01 (v213) pins it with four axioms (μ₄-deck equivariant, Plücker-preserving, positive/stochastic, external-module-explicit); the third research contract alongside U_wall and G_metric.",
